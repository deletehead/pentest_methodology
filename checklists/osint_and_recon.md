# OSINT & Recon
Open source intelligence (OSINT) and reconnaissance checklist. This is for passive enumeration of a target company/entity.

## Google
 - [ ] Simply *Google the target*. What does the company do? What information do they store/process? What's their business?
 - [ ] Check for sensitive documents:
    - [ ] Google: `site:firenation.com filetype:docx` (also: `doc`, `xls`, `xlsx`, `ppt`, `pptx`, `pdf`, etc)
 - [ ] Identify high-profile employees (chairman of boards, CEO, CFO, CIO, CISO) or highly-privileged users (sysadmins, netadmins, devs, infosec)

## Social Media
Check photos for metadata or even interesting data captured. Examples could be badges, information on whiteboards, building layout.
 - LinkedIn
    - [ ] Check employees. Look for security team, developers, admins. Get a feel for tech stack.
 - Facebook
 - Twitter
 - Instagram
 - Job Postings
    - [ ] What positions do they need filled?
    - [ ] What technology stack are they looking for/skills desired?
    - [ ] Recruiter contact info

## Moar OSINT
 - [ ] Harvest emails:
    - [ ] `theHarvester`: 
      ```
      theHarvester -d firenation.com -b all
      sqlite3
      > select * from results
      ```
    - [ ] Other resources for emails: https://hunter.io, LinkedIn, etc.
    - [ ] Have you found any? What's the naming convention? Pull employees from LI and generate a list of usernames/emails for password spraying
 - [ ] Harvest creds:
    - [ ] https://haveibeenpwned.com/
    - [ ] https://www.dehashed.com/
    - [ ] https://scylla.sh
 - [ ] Github and source code repositories:
    - [ ] Search git for relevant repos
    - [ ] Look for developers identified in OSINT. Sometimes they put secrets or creds in personal repos. Tsk tsk tsk!
    - [ ] Try [`gitleaks`](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) or [`trufflehog`](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog)
 - [ ] PasteBin
    - [ ] Check for domains, company names, high-profile employees
 - [ ] Cloud checks
    - [ ] Wide open S3 buckets? https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/
 - [ ] DNS and Email checks
    - [ ] Run [`dnstwist`](https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist.git). Get a feel for alt domains. (Can we use them for to phish?)
    - [ ] SPF, DMARC, and DKIM settings:
      ```
      dig txt firenation.com                       # check for SPF
      dig txt _dmarc.firenation.com                # check for DMARC
      dig txt selector._domainkey.firenation.com   # check for DKIM
      ```
    - [ ] Whois info
    - [ ] IP geolocation
    - [ ] Use a tool such as [`gobuster`](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster.git) or `dnscan` to brute force subdomains:
      ```
      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbsec/dnscan/master/subdomains-10000.txt -O /tmp/subdomains.lst
      gobuster dns -d firenation.com -w /tmp/subdomains.lst
      ```
 - [ ] Check https://www.shodan.io/ for machines from `firenation.com`. Take special note of services (esp wierd ones) and vulnerabilities.
